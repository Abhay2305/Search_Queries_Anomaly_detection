### Overview

The Jupyter Notebook titled "Search Queries Anomaly Detection" likely focuses on identifying unusual patterns or anomalies in search query data. This can involve preprocessing the queries, analyzing the data for outliers, and applying statistical or machine learning techniques to detect anomalies.


1. **Cleaning the Query:** The function ensures that the search query is converted to lowercase, making the analysis case-insensitive. This is important for consistency and accuracy in text analysis.
2. **Splitting into Words:** Using regular expressions, the function extracts alphabetic words from the query. This step filters out numbers, punctuation, and special characters, focusing only on meaningful words.
3. **Output:** The function returns a list of words, which can then be used for further analysis such as frequency counting, anomaly detection, or building machine learning models.

This setup ensures you have all the necessary tools to preprocess search queries, detect anomalies, and visualize the results effectively.
